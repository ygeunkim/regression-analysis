# Linear Regression Analysis

```{r}
data(BioOxyDemand, package = "MPV")
(BioOxyDemand <-
  BioOxyDemand %>% 
  tbl_df())
```

## Relation

We wonder how `x` affects `y`, especially linearly.

- Functional relation: mathematical equation, $$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$
- Statistical relation: embeded with noise

So we try to estimate

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$$

```{r}
BioOxyDemand %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point()
```


Looking just with the eyes, we can see the linear relationship. Regression analysis estimates the relationship statistically.


```{r}
BioOxyDemand %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_point()
```
